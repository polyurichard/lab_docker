Complete the tasks for the GenAI Powered Quiz App we have developed in the previous lab.

- **Task 1: Dockerize the App and Run It with Streamlit**
  - Set your GitHub API key as an environment variable.
  - Install dependencies, set up a virtual environment, and run the initial `llm.py` script.
  - Test the app locally by running the Streamlit app.
  - Create and configure a Dockerfile for the app.
  - Build the Docker image.
  - Run the app container with the appropriate environment variables.

- **Task 2: Connect Your App to MongoDB to Store Generated Questions**
  - **Part A:**  
    - Run a MongoDB container locally.
    - Update the app's code to use the MongoDB connection URI.
    - Launch the Streamlit app and generate questions.
    - Verify that the questions are stored in MongoDB using container commands and the MongoDB shell.
    
  - **Part B:**  
    - Create a Docker network for inter-container communication.
    - Start the MongoDB container on the created network.
    - Update the app's URI to target MongoDB by its container name.
    - Build and run the app container within the same Docker network.
    - Generate questions and verify they are saved in the database.

- **Task 3: Create a Docker-Compose File to Run the App, MongoDB, and Mongo Express**
  - Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file that defines services for the app, MongoDB, and Mongo Express.
  - Include environment variables (optionally using a `.env` file) for the GitHub API key and MongoDB credentials.
  - Run the docker-compose stack (with or without the rebuild flag).
  - Test the Streamlit app and verify that generated questions appear in the Mongo Express dashboard.
