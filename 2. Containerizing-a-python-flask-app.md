# Containerizing a python flask app

In this section, we will containerize a Python Flask app using Docker. 

## Preparation

Open a new VSCode terminal.&#x20;

Check that the docker command-line client is available.

```
docker --version
```

Create the folder `flask-hello2`complete the following tasks.

```
mkdir flask-hello2
cd flask-hello2
```

## Task 1: Pulling a python docker image

Pull a docker inmage `python:slim`, a lightweight version of python docker image, from Dockerhub. The name of the image is `python` and the tag is `slim`. 


```
docker pull python:slim
```

The Docker image will be pulled to the Docker host if it is not available.

<img src=".gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt="">

</div>

Check that the image is successfully pulled.

```
docker image ls
```

<div align="left">

<img src=".gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt="">

</div>

Run the image and launch the bash shell.

```
docker run -it python:slim bash
```

Checking that the `python:slim` Docker container is running.

<img src=".gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt="">

</div>

In the terminal, check the Python version inside the Docker container.

```
python --version
```

What is the version of Python inside the container?



Run a python statement inside the container.

```
python3 -c "print(1+2)"
```

Exit the bash shell.

```
exit
```

After you have exited the container's shell, the container is now in the stopped state.



In the Docker VSCode extension, right-click the stoped (exited) container and select `remove`to remove the container.

</div>



## Task 2: Containerizing the python app

Inside the `flask-hello2` folder, create a Python script `app.py` as follows.

```python
import os
import socket
from flask import Flask,request,jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def main():
    return "Welcome Python flask!"

@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return 'I am '+socket.gethostname()

@app.route('/users')
def get_users():
    json_data = [{"name":"alice","age":18},{"name":"bob", "age": 22}]
    return jsonify(json_data),200

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000, debug=True, use_reloader=True)   
```

Save the file (**Ctrl+S**).

In the same folder, create a file`Dockerfile` as follows.

```docker
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:slim

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Also, define `requirements.txt` as follows.

```
flask
```

Your folder structure should be as follows.

<div align="left">

<img src=".gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt="">

</div>

Build the docker image using the `docker build` command.

* The option `-t` specifies the docker image's name &#x20;
* The dot indicates that the current directory will be used for the _Docker build context_ (where the files and directories will be available to the Docker engine when you run docker build)&#x20;

```
docker build . -t myapp
```



Check that the `myapp` docker image is created.

```
docker image ls
```

<div align="left">

<img src=".gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt="">

</div>

You can now view your new docker image under the VSCode Docker Explorer.

<div align="left">

<img src=".gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt="">

</div>

To run the docker image, execute&#x20;

```
docker run -p 15000:5000 myapp 
```

The `-p` option is used to map the port `5000` inside (in which the flask app is listening) to the container host's port`15000`.

To access the application outside the container, we should use the port `15000`.&#x20;

* If you are using your own local machine, you can access the application at `http://localhost:15000`.
* If you are using the GitHub Codespaces,  navigate to the URL mapped to localhost port 5000.

In the browser, navigates to the `/, /about` and `/users` endpoint to view the app.


Start  two more instances of `myapp` container

```
docker run -p 15001:5000 myapp 
docker run -p 15002:5000 myapp 
```

For these two containers, the ports `15001` and `15002` are mapped to the port `5000` inside the container. You can access the application at `http://localhost:15001` and `http://localhost:15002` respectively. 

Navigates to the `/about` endpoints of the ports corresponding to the containers. Observe the hostname of the containers.

In your running container in the Docker Explorer in VSCode, right-click the running containers to stop and remove the containers.

## Push your Docker image to Docker hub

Apply a Docker account (if you don't have one yet).

[https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/)

In the terminal, login to Docker hub using your ID and password ( You may also apply an access token and use the token as password for login [https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/))

```
docker login
```

Before you can push your image to the Docker hub, you need to tag your image with your Docker ID as the prefix.

`docker tag myapp:latest [your Docker ID]/myapp:latest`

`docker push [your Docker ID]/myapp:latest`



Push your image to the Docker hub.

`docker push [your Docker ID]/myapp`



Check that your Docker image is pushed to the Dockerhub. Example:

<div align="left">

<img src=".gitbook/assets/image (19).png" alt="">

</div>

You can now run your app at any computer with Docker installed!

`docker run -p 15000:5000 [your Dockerhub ID]/myapp`
